						     <u>Your card expires but your account doesn't:</u>
							 <p><i>An expiration serves two purposes. First, a physical credit card can only last for about three-to-four years' worth of swiping and dipping. An expiration date provides your issuer with a date on which to send you a new card before the old one falls apart. Second, the expiration offers a small measure of identity theft protection for cardholders, since it is another piece of information that you would only have if you had the card in your possession.

Most credit card companies send you a new card before your current one expires. If for some reason they don't and you try to use a card that's past its expiration date, it will be declined. But your account should still be valid â€” you just need to ask your card issuer for a new card.</i></p>

						     <p><i>As of 2013, there were over 1.635 billion credit cards in circulation around the world, according to SuperMoney.<br>If all of those cards were laid end-to-end, they would stretch over 86,981 miles, which would circle the earth three and a half times.</i></p>

						     <u>There are 10,000 worldwide credit card transactions every second:</u>
